Explanatory Variables: These are the variables that you believe have an influence on the cost. They are typically the inputs or factors that can be controlled or manipulated. Examples of explanatory variables in a cost reduction analysis could include:
Labor costs
Raw material costs
Energy consumption
Production volume
Marketing expenses
Overhead costs
Transportation costs
Inventory levels



Response Variables: These are the variables that you are trying to predict or explain using the explanatory variables. In the context of cost reduction, the response variable is likely to be the total cost or a specific cost metric. Examples of response variables could include:
Total cost
Cost per unit
Cost of goods sold (COGS)
Operating expenses
Maintenance costs
Distribution costs
